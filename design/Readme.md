Universal Card UI Design
===============
The ActiveLayout package implements a Universal Card UI, which is considerably different than traditional web templates, in that it's both optimized for mobile first, and scales up to ultra-high resolution HDTV monitors.  The reason we both _can_ and _want_ to consider a universal app is due to the economics of the healthcare market.  

Regulatory approval makes it very difficult to bring an application to market, and costly to make changes.  So, when a version of an app gets certified, we want it to run on as many devices as we can.  Put another, given limited resources, budget that would normally get spent on extra developers making device optimized versions of an app often winds up getting spent on the regulatory and credentialing process in the healthcare industry.

We're also able to make this design decision because the healthcare market is highly constrained in its uses cases and users.  A universal app might not work in other industries such as gaming; but in healthcare, device usage is usually a function of ergonomics, and we can make a number of informed decisions about how patients and clinicians will use an app on different devices.  As such, the design space is constrained enough that a universal template begins to make a lot of business sense.

The cost of a universal template, of course, is that it has a very particular layout.
